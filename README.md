# Introduction
A replacement dds plugin for 3ds Max, that provides support for newer dwFlags used in textures for DX10+ games. 

# Background
When Bethesda released the Creation Kit for Fallout 4, the download included various other mod tools - a NIF format exporter for 3ds Max 2015 was among those tools. Unfortunately 3ds Max 2015 doesn't support all the dds formats that Fallout 4 uses, so Bethesda suggested using what they did - TGA format. However, if one should have the desire to create models using existing textures, messing around with converting back and forth between image formats, can quickly become tedious.
